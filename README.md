# Hangman


## Description
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

### What it does
- The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
- The player guesses letters to uncover the hidden word.
- For each correct guess, the coresponding blanks in the word are filled
- For each incorrect guess, the player loses a life
- The game continues until the player either guesses the word or runs out of lives.

### Aim of the Project
The project serves as a hands- on exercise in object-oriented programming (OOP)
with Python.
It demonstrates the implementation of a simple game using classes and methods.

### What I Learned
- String manipulation
- List operations
- Loops (for iteration and repetition)
- Conditional statements
- Object-oriented programming concepts in Python.
- Handling user input and implementing game logic.
